            Byte (byte):

            Size: 1 byte
            Range: 0 to 255
            Description: Used to store positive whole numbers between 0 and 255.
            Short (short):

            Size: 2 bytes
            Range: -32,768 to 32,767
            Description: Used to store signed whole numbers with a wider range than byte.
            Int (int):

            Size: 4 bytes
            Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
            Description: Used to store signed whole numbers with a larger range.
            Long (long):

            Size: 8 bytes
            Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
            Description: Used to store very large signed whole numbers.
            Float (float):

            Size: 4 bytes
            Range: Approximately ±1.5 x 10^-45 to ±3.4 x 10^38
            Description: Used to store decimal numbers with a limited precision and a wide range.
            Double (double):

            Size: 8 bytes
            Range: Approximately ±5.0 x 10^-324 to ±1.7 x 10^308
            Description: Used to store decimal numbers with higher precision and a wider range compared to float.
            Boolean (bool):

            Size: 1 byte (commonly 2 bytes in memory, but considered 1 byte)
            Values: true or false
            Description: Used to store true/false or binary values.
            Char (char):

            Size: 2 bytes
            Range: Unicode characters, representing a single character.
            String (string):

            Size: Depends on the length of the string
            Description: Used to store text or a sequence of characters.
            Each data type in C# has a specific size in memory and a defined range of values it can hold.
            Understanding these data types and their limitations is essential for choosing the right type for 
            different programming tasks.
